## 📖 About

This project is a **training exercise** to learn and practice building responsive and adaptive layouts in Flutter. The app dynamically adjusts its UI based on the device screen width using `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery`.

- ✅ **Responsive Design** — Fluid layouts that adapt to any screen size
- ✅ **Adaptive Layout** — Different UI structures for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop
- ✅ **LayoutBuilder** — Breakpoint-based widget rendering
- ✅ **MediaQuery** — Detecting screen dimensions for conditional UI
- ✅ **Custom Widgets** — Reusable components across layouts
